Refer back to the OOSD coursework spec, which tell you exactly whats needed to be done and finished to get the good grade

CSCCORE1I
Object Oriented Software Development
Coursework Guidelines
The coursework for this strand (yes, OOSD is a strand with in CSCCORE1I) involves designing a working
software in a team of maximum three students (you can work solo if you want but that’s discouraged).
This coursework is important for two reasons.
1. First, it gives you the opportunity to experience the benefits and challenges of working in a team
(yes, you will know during and after your project why this is important for people working on
software projects).
2. Second, it allows you to design and develop software using object-oriented concepts of C++ in an
area or domain you are passionate about (means, we allow you to be creative with what you can
do).
The remainder of this document explains the following:
1. What do we mean by working software?
2. How to choose a topic for your project?
3. What to submit and how?
4. How do we assess your work?
5. What are the important deadlines?
What do we mean by working software?
A working software demonstrates a substantial functionality compared to the toy programs we do in the
laboratory classes or seminars. Specifically, the implementation should consist of a few classes that
demonstrate the concepts related to object-oriented programming. For example, your implementations
should use the following (minimum) fundamental concepts:
1. Objects and Classes
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Exception Handling
In addition to the above, your application, where required, will also be evaluated based on the following
C++ language related topics:
1. Functions
2. Arrays, Strings and Vectors
3. Pointers and References
Depending on the type of the project you are doing, you can also choose to include external libraries for
core functionality or concepts. For example,
1. Graphics libraries such as OpenGL
2. UI libraries and tools such as Qt
3. Database libraries
4. Any other tool or library required in your application
How to choose a topic?
When it comes to choosing a topic, it would be easier if you can think in terms of different application
areas of computer science and choose one you are interested in or have some background in. For
example, a computer application or software can be classified as:
1. Accounting e.g. transaction management
2. Documentation e.g. word processor, email
3. Data management e.g. spreadsheet, university record management
4. Financial e.g. banking, day trading
5. Reservation system
6. Entertainment e.g. games, art, creativity
7. Education e.g. classroom management, survey management
8. Simulation e.g. bouncing ball, object collisions
9. Media authoring e.g. image editing, video editing
Please see the full list here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software
Once you have chosen the area, you can think of a project or application you want to implement using
object-oriented concepts in C++. For example, possible project titles could be:
1. Bus Reservation System (need to store data in a database)
2. Banking Record System (need to store data in a database)
3. Computer Game (this would require an understanding of graphics)
4. Student Database System (need to store data in a database)
5. Super Market Billing System (need to store data in a database)
6. Employee’s Management System (need to store data in a database)
7. Animation (this would require an understanding of graphics)
The project idea can then be refined by identifying the functionality it should support (i.e. a list of clearly
defined functions as in the example below). In order to identify the functionality, you can think of
yourself as a software developer who is contacted by a client to implement the software. The client
would provide a description of the software. The description can be in a written document or the
customer could be interviewed to gather the requirements. Once you have the project description, you
can analyse it to identify the functionality to implement.
Example Project: University Record Management
For example, consider the case of an application for university record management (i.e. Data
Management category). For such an application, you (i.e. the software developer) may have to study the
requirements of a university (i.e. the client) and finalize the required functionality, which may include the
following (obviously more functionality can be easily identified):
1. Data entry related functionality:
a. Register a student
b. Add a new course
c. Get the details of a programme of study
2. Record editing related functionality:
a. Edit student details
b. Edit course
3. Printing related functionality:
a. Print course details
b. Print student details
c. Generate student list
4. Database related functionality:
a. Create new table
b. Edit table
Similarly, if you choose to do a project in other areas like gaming, computer art, education, or simulation
etc, you need to identify a set of functionalities that needs to be implemented as objects and classes in
C++.
The next step then is to think in terms of object-oriented constructs to solve the problem. Specifically, the
following needs to be done before implementation i.e. coding can begin:
1. Identify the classes
a. Identify the attributes associated with each class.
b. Identify the responsibilities (methods) associated with each class.
2. Determine the relationships among the classes in your solution.
3. Draw the class diagram to visually present the relationships among classes.

How to submit and what should be included in your
submission?
You should submit the following on Moodle before the submission deadline expires: (all links will be
available under ‘All Submission Links’ tile on your course page)
1. Team contract document. Available here:
https://live.moodle.hope.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=32417&redirect=1 and submit on
Moodle
2. Presentation: A recorded presentation with voice and presenters’ face of your software having
the following structure or contents (max 10 minutes):
a. What is your software about? (1 slide)
b. What classes it has and how you identify them? (1-3 slides)
c. UML class diagram(s) (1-2 slides)
d. Functionality supported by your software (1-2 slides)
e. Demonstration of the functionality supported by your software (by running it and
explaining the working)
f. Limitations of your implementation (1 slide)
g. Contribution of each member (1 slide)
h. Note: team member can agree on how they choose the slides to talk about
3. Your final project in a zip archive.
Please note that if there is any change to submission procedure, we will let you know via Moodle. In
general, all the submission links will be provided under the ‘All Submission Links’ tab on the coursework
